# IrrlichtBAW

Build A World fork of Irrlicht, currently aiming for a threadable and Vulkan-centered API (but currently works on OpenGL only).

We forked after realizing we have too many patches which entail big API changes to ever be merged into stock Irrlicht.

For those not faint of heart, you can find out more about what this is and how it differs from stock Irrlicht by reading this thread:

Excuse us for not providing a proper readme, we (@devsh, @Crisspl and @Przemog1) are really busy with our day-business of DevSH Graphics Programming Sp. z o.o.

This framework has been kindly begun, donated under the Apache 2.0 license, and almost entirely sponsored by Build A World Aps., and the `stable-ish` branch is used in production releases of [Build A World EDU](https://edu.buildaworld.net/), since 2015.

If you feel like you'd be interesting in improving and maintaining this repository's readmes and the wiki, contact @devsh on Discord.

# Official Support (Discord)

We have no forums or message boards as of now, simply as there is no need for any project with a community of programmers under 100.

There's also a skype support group, reach @devsh for a private invite.
